AI Engineer (MBA, MSc) specializing in agentic AI workflows, MCP toolchains, and scalable deployment. Experienced in
designing multi-agent systems that integrate LLMs, retrieval, tool use, and conversational control. Built projects including an
MCP augmentation server with optional VLM integration, a dual-agent orchestration pipeline, a domain knowledge RAG
system, and research on turn detection for AI-powered language learning.
 AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner and AI Practitioner, with 2 years of portfolio work across deep learning, LLMOps, and MCP
deployment. Strong documentation and cross-functional collaboration skills, converting research concepts into reliable,
production-ready workflows.SUMMARY
SELECTED PROJECTS (2024–PRESENT)
Nov 2025 Yoga Assistant Knowledge RAG | Retrieval-Augmented System

Practitioner + AI Practitioner
Deployed a 10-class car image classifier (>96% accuracy, <300ms inference) in TensorFlowJS; reduced
model size to ~3MB.
Replaced U2-Net with DIS for salient object segmentation; cut training loss to 0.06 after 200k+ iterations
and deployed via TorchServe/Flask.
Built barcode segmentation model (Mobilenet v2/v3) compressed from 22MB → 1.2MB, achieving 96.5% IoU
on live video frames.
Created car color detection algorithm using Detectron2 + OpenCV; deployed as a microservice with Flask,
Docker, and AWS.
Scaled datasets from <800 → 50k+ images using a Selenium + AWS scraper and augmentation pipelines.
Advocated and implemented WandB + DVC for reproducibility; introduced Cookiecutter + Sphinx for repo
hygiene.
Authored internal technical papers and experiment reports to standardize methods and share findings
across R&D.
First in company to achieve Agile certification; mentored team on sprint planning, retros, and story
estimation.
