### Learning Philosophy

I believe that in the rapidly evolving field of AI and cloud technology, continuous learning is not just beneficial but rather essential. My approach combines structured learning with hands-on experimentation, ensuring I stay current with emerging technologies while building practical expertise.

**Current Focus Areas:**

- Multi-agent systems and orchestration
- Cloud-native AI architectures
- Korean language proficiency for global collaboration
