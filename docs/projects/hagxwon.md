![HagXwon](../assets/images/project_icons/Modern_HagXwon_Logo.webp)

**Enterprise AI architecture for transforming Korea's $20B+ private education industry. An MBA + AI approach combining business strategy, technical architecture, and hands-on AI implementation.**

---

## Project Overview

Designed and prototyped a comprehensive AI-powered learning platform for Korean hagwons (private education centers) as part of the **GenAI Bootcamp 2025**. The project demonstrates the intersection of **business strategy and AI engineering**, addressing a $20B market opportunity with 70,000+ hagwons across South Korea.

<div class="section-label">MBA + AI Approach</div>

This project showcases the unique combination of **business acumen and technical execution**:

- **Business Case Development**: Market analysis, ROI projections, stakeholder impact assessment
- **Enterprise Architecture**: TOGAF ADM methodology, C4 model diagrams, compliance frameworks
- **Technical Implementation**: Built 6+ working AI prototypes using local models (Ollama)
- **Strategic Planning**: 3-year phased implementation roadmap

<div class="section-label">Problem Statement</div>

Despite $20B+ annual investment in hagwon education, students struggle with real-world English fluency. Traditional rote-learning methods prioritize test scores over conversational ability, leaving a critical gap in practical language skills.

## Business Strategy

### Market Opportunity

- **$20.6 billion USD** spent annually on hagwon education in South Korea
- **70,000+ hagwons** operate across Korea, enrolling millions of students
- **15M+ people worldwide** actively learning Korean (7th most learned language globally)
- **English proficiency gap**: Test-driven methods fail to build real-world fluency

### Revenue Model

| Model                     | Description                                     |
| ------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| **B2B SaaS**              | AI-powered tools licensed to hagwons            |
| **Direct-to-Consumer**    | AI learning apps for students & parents         |
| **Freemium Model**        | Free basic AI tools, premium features for a fee |
| **Enterprise Consulting** | Custom AI integration for hagwon chains         |

### Competitive Advantage

- **AI-Powered Personalization**: Tailors lessons to individual learners
- **Scalability**: AI tutors support thousands of students simultaneously
- **Regulatory Compliance**: PIPA-aligned for secure student data management
- **Bilingual Focus**: Korean-to-English AND English-to-Korean (not just one-way)
