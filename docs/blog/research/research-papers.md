## Published Work

### Turn Detection in AI-Powered Language Learning

<div class="section-label">Dissertation - 2024</div>

An examination of turn detection mechanisms in AI language learning systems, with particular focus on cultural, neurodivergent, and ethical implications.

**Abstract:**  
This dissertation investigates how AI systems detect and respond to conversational turns in language learning contexts. It explores the challenges of implementing culturally-sensitive turn detection, accommodating neurodivergent communication patterns, and addressing ethical considerations in AI-mediated language instruction.

**Key Contributions:**

- Analysis of turn detection algorithms in conversational AI
- Cultural variation in turn-taking norms (focus on Korean vs. Western patterns)
- Neurodivergent communication considerations
- Ethical framework for AI language learning systems
- Design recommendations for inclusive AI tutors

**Published:** Academia.edu, 2024

## Work in Progress

### EdgeMind: Multi-Agent Orchestration in the Transition from 5G to 6G

<div class="section-label">Research Paper - In Progress</div>

Exploring agentic orchestration frameworks for edge computing in the transition from 5G to 6G networks, with emphasis on sub-100ms decisioning and distributed intelligence.

**Research Focus:**

- Multi-agent swarm coordination at network edge
- Sub-100ms decision-making for latency-critical applications
- Integration with Multi-Access Edge Computing (MEC)
- Structured agent memory and ReAct-style critique loops
- JSON-based orchestration protocols

**Methodology:**

- Framework implementation using Strands Agents
- Performance benchmarking on edge infrastructure
- Comparison with centralized AI approaches
- Real-world use case validation (autonomous vehicles, AR/VR, industrial IoT)

**Status:** Framework implemented, paper in preparation  
**Related Project:** [EdgeMind 5G-MEC](../../projects/edgemind.md)

### Beyond Human Mimicry: Rethinking AI Identity

<div class="section-label">Position Paper - In Progress</div>

A critical examination of AI identity formation beyond human-centric models, exploring alternative frameworks for understanding artificial intelligence.

**Research Questions:**

- Should AI systems mimic human identity patterns?
- What alternative identity frameworks exist for AI?
- How do we evaluate AI "selfhood" without anthropomorphism?
- What are the ethical implications of AI identity design?

**Theoretical Framework:**

- Critique of anthropomorphic AI design
- Non-human intelligence models (collective, distributed, fluid)
- Identity as emergent property vs. designed feature
- Ethical considerations in AI consciousness research

**Status:** Literature review and framework development phase

## Exploratory Research

### CFD Memory: Fluid-Inspired Memory Systems

<div class="section-label">Concept Exploration</div>

Investigating fluid-inspired memory systems where contextual relevance emerges from dynamic flow patterns rather than static vector weights.

**Core Concepts:**

- Memory decay modeled as fluid dissipation
- Attention turbulence for context switching
- Mesh-based semantic diffusion
- Flow dynamics for information retrieval

**Inspiration:** Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) applied to AI memory architecture

**Status:** Conceptual phase, exploring mathematical foundations
