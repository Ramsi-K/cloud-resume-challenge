# 300 Days Of Code - Year 2 (2025)

<div class="section-label">Learning Journey</div>

Welcome back to my coding journey! This repository marks the second year of my 300 Days of Code challenge.

Last year focused heavily on daily logs and updates within the realm of vision technologies. This year, the focus shifts towards deeper dives into key bootcamps and substantial projects, moving away from daily standup-style logging.

The goal remains consistent: dedicated coding effort. However, the definition of a "minimum viable day" is now centered on completing the LeetCode daily challenge. This ensures consistent problem-solving practice while allowing for more flexibility to concentrate on larger learning modules and projects.

---

## Challenge Structure

- **LeetCode**: Daily challenges
- **Bootcamps**: Each bootcamp tracked as a submodule
- **Projects**: Larger projects get their own folders
- **Milestones**: Progress logged via sprint highlights & project completions, not daily standups

### Strategic Learning Phases

Instead of tracking 365 individual days, I'm organizing the year into strategic learning phases:

| Phase | Primary Focus                  | Timeline | Key Learning & Projects                                                                                                                                                                               |
| ----- | ------------------------------ | -------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
