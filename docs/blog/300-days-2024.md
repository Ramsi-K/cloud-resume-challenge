# 300 Days Of Code - Year 1 (2024)

<div class="section-label">Learning Journey</div>

Completed 198 of 300 days focused on computer vision, deep learning, and foundational AI engineering skills. This repository is archived and serves as a record of 2024 Year 1 of 300 Days of Coding.

Year 2 continues in [300 Days of Code 2025](300-days-2025.md).

---

## Overview

This repository contains:

- Daily logs documenting the coding challenge
- Experiments with computer vision, reinforcement learning, and MLOps Zoomcamp
- Early projects like Notebookify (no longer maintained)

<div class="section-label">Key Achievements</div>

- Started strong with Computer Vision (LunaNet3D, YOLOv3, monocular depth)
- Explored MLOps Zoomcamp (partial completion)
- Built Notebookify project (deprecated after learning it didn't fit workflow)
- Main win: consistent daily coding habit for 200 days

---

## Final Update

The last task in this challenge was on 2024-08-29:  
[American Civil War Ciphers](https://github.com/Ramsi-K/python-projects/tree/main/Route-and-Rail-Ciphers)

Work included:

- Implemented and refined Route Cipher decryption
- Built brute-force key searcher for ciphers
- Implemented Rail Fence Cipher (encrypt + decrypt)
- Explored cipher classification and key dictionaries

The daily log ends at Day 198.

## 30-Day Sprint Retrospectives

Detailed sprint notes are available for Days 1-180. These cover highlights for each 30-day block:

- [Sprint 01-30: Getting Started](https://github.com/Ramsi-K/300-days-of-code/blob/main/retrospectives/sprint_01-30.md)
- [Sprint 31-60: Building Momentum](https://github.com/Ramsi-K/300-days-of-code/blob/main/retrospectives/sprint_31-60.md)
- [Sprint 61-90: Deep Dive](https://github.com/Ramsi-K/300-days-of-code/blob/main/retrospectives/sprint_61-90.md)
- [Sprint 91-120: Consolidation](https://github.com/Ramsi-K/300-days-of-code/blob/main/retrospectives/sprint_91-120.md)
- [Sprint 121-150: Advanced Topics](https://github.com/Ramsi-K/300-days-of-code/blob/main/retrospectives/sprint_121-150.md)
- [Sprint 151-180: Final Push](https://github.com/Ramsi-K/300-days-of-code/blob/main/retrospectives/sprint_1511-180.md)

Daily logs continue until Day 198, after which the challenge was wrapped.

## Project Highlights

### Computer Vision Projects

<div class="section-label">Core Focus</div>

- **LunaNet3D**: 3D object detection and segmentation
- **YOLOv3 Implementation**: Real-time object detection
- **Monocular Depth Estimation**: Single-camera depth prediction
- **Image Classification**: Various CNN architectures

### Notebookify

<div class="section-label">Lessons Learned</div>

A month-long project to convert Jupyter notebooks to Markdown with Google Drive integration. Key learnings:

- Discovered personal workflow doesn't align with notebook-heavy development
- Gained experience with Google Drive API
- Learned importance of validating project fit before deep investment
- Project deprecated but valuable learning experience

### LeetCode Practice

<div class="section-label">Daily Discipline</div>

Consistent problem-solving practice across:

- Data structures and algorithms
- String manipulation
- Array operations
- SQL queries (Pandas problems)

---

## Technology Stack

**Primary Languages**: Python

**Key Libraries**:

- PyTorch, TensorFlow (Deep Learning)
- OpenCV (Computer Vision)
- Pandas, NumPy (Data Processing)
- Jupyter, Google Colab (Development)

**Tools**:

- Git, GitHub
- Google Drive API
- Selenium (Web automation)
- Jinja2 (Templating)

## Reflections

<div class="section-label">What Worked</div>

- Daily commitment to coding built strong habits
- Computer vision projects provided solid foundation
- LeetCode practice improved problem-solving skills
- Sprint retrospectives helped track progress

<div class="section-label">What Didn't Work</div>

- MLOps Zoomcamp incomplete (scope too large)
- Notebookify project didn't match actual workflow
- Some days focused on tooling rather than core skills

<div class="section-label">Moving Forward</div>

Year 2 (2025) shifts focus to:

- Generative AI and LLMs
- Multi-agent systems
- Cloud architecture (AWS, Azure, GCP)
- Production-ready projects
