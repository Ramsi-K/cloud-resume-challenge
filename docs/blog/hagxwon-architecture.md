<div class="section-label">AI-Powered Learning</div>

The platform integrates multiple AI capabilities:

- **Conversational AI**: Natural language interaction for immersive practice
- **Speech Recognition**: ASR for pronunciation feedback
- **Text-to-Speech**: TTS for listening comprehension
- **Adaptive Learning**: Personalized curriculum based on learner progress

<div class="section-label">Enterprise Integration</div>

Designed for scalability and enterprise deployment:

- Microservices architecture for modularity
- Cloud-native deployment (AWS/Azure/GCP)
- API-first design for third-party integrations
- Multi-tenant support for institutional use

<div class="section-label">Cultural Authenticity</div>

Emphasis on culturally-grounded learning:

- Korean cultural context integration
- Authentic dialogue scenarios
- Cultural nuance training
- Native speaker validation
